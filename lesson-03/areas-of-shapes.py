# This program computes the areas of three different shapes: Square, Rectangle, Circle
#
#
# What is the length of a side of the square? 5
# The area of the square is: 25.0
# What is the length of rectangle? 6
# What is the width of the rectangle? 7
# The area of the rectangle is: 42.0
# What is the radius of the circle? 5
# The area of the circle is: 78.5
